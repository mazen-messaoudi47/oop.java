# Simple Digital Library Management System

## Project Description
This is a simple digital library management system implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The system allows managing books, borrowers, and borrowing processes.

## Features
- Add new books (both paper books and e-books)
- Add new borrowers
- Borrow books
- Return books
- Search for books and borrowers
- Display all books and borrowers
- Display borrowed books by a specific borrower

## OOP Concepts Implemented
1. Encapsulation: All class fields are private and accessed through getters/setters.
2. Inheritance: PaperBook and EBook inherit from the abstract Book class.
3. Polymorphism: The matches() method is implemented differently in Book and Borrower classes.
4. Interfaces: The Searchable interface defines common search functionality.
5. Abstraction: The Book class is abstract with an abstract getBookType() method.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Java JDK installed (version 8 or higher recommended)
2. Clone this repository
3. Compile and run the LibraryApp class:
